        <h2><strong>Nothing better than homemade yummy churros!</strong></h2>
        <h3>Make them for a morning breakfast or an evening dessert!</h3>
        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 quarts oil for frying</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white sugar, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine water, 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar, salt, and 2 tablespoons
                vegetable oil in a small saucepan and place over medium heat. 
                Bring to a boil and remove from the heat. Stir in flour, stirring 
                until mixture forms a ball.</li>
            <li>Heat oil for frying in a deep fryer or deep pot to 375 degrees F 
                (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough to a sturdy pastry bag fitted with a medium star 
                tip. Carefully pipe a few 5- to 6-inch strips of dough into the hot 
                oil; work in batches so you don't crowd the fryer. Cook until golden; 
                use a spider or slotted spoon to transfer churros to paper towels to 
                drain.</li>
            <li>Combine 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon. Roll drained churros in cinnamon and 
                sugar mixture.</li>
        </ol>
