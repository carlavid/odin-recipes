        <div class="recipe">
        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>6 fresh chile peppers</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package queso asadero, cut into 3/4-inch thick strip</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, separated</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup vegetable shortening for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven broiler; set the oven rack about 6 inches
            below the heat source. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Place peppers onto the prepared baking sheet and broil until 
            skins are blackened and blistered, about 10 minutes. Use tongs to
            rotate peppers often to char all sides. Place blackened peppers 
            into a bowl and tightly seal with plastic wrap. Allow peppers to 
            steam as they cool, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove skin from peppers, then cut a slit down the long side 
            of each one to remove seeds and core. Rinse peppers inside and out
            and pat dry with paper towels. Stuff peppers with strips of cheese.</li>
            <li>Whisk egg yolks and baking powder in a bowl until combined. 
            Beat egg whites with an electric mixer in a separate bowl until 
            stiff peaks form. Gently fold beaten whites into the yolk mixture. 
            Place flour into a separate shallow bowl.</li>
            <li>Melt vegetable shortening in a skillet over medium heat. Roll 
            each stuffed pepper in flour, tap off excess flour, and dip into 
            the egg mixture to coat both sides. Gently lay coated peppers into 
            the hot shortening. Fry peppers until lightly golden brown and cheese 
            has melted, about 5 minutes per side.</li>
        </ol>
